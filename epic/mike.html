	<p><strong>Name: </strong> Mike</p>
	<p><strong>Age: </strong>28</p>
	<p><strong>Gender: </strong>Male</p>
	<p><strong>Occupation: </strong>Uber Driver</p>
	<p><strong>Technology: </strong> 	Mike has a Iphone 8 that he bought a few years ago. It's a little slow but gets the job done.
	<p><strong>Story: </strong>
		Mike is a 28 year old bachelor. He has an OK job as an Uber Driver, pays $25k/year. He has 2 friends Robbie and Jay who he hangs out with and smokes weed with once a week.
	Mike is a little anti-social so going out to bars to socialize is not so fun.
	He feels lonely sometimes.
	Maybe adopting a pet would be nice.
	But that would be too much work. Mike knows he's not responsible enough to walk a dog everyday.
	It's still nice to look at pictures of cute animals and think about adopting one sometime in the future, especially on a slow Friday night.
